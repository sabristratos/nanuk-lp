# Directory Structure

## Key Directories Explained

### `app/`
This is where the core logic of your application resides. It includes:
*   **Models**: Represent your database tables and interact with your data.
*   **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
*   **Livewire Components**: PHP classes that power dynamic frontend components.
*   **Middleware**: Filter HTTP requests entering your application.
*   **Service Providers**: Bootstrap and configure various parts of the application.
*   **Console Commands**: Custom commands for the Artisan CLI.

### `config/`
Contains all of your application's configuration files. It's good practice to familiarize yourself with these files and the available options.

### `database/`
Houses your database migrations, model factories, and seeders. Migrations allow you to version control your database schema.

### `public/`
This is the web server's document root. It contains the `index.php` file, which is the entry point for all requests, as well as your compiled assets (CSS, JS, images).

### `resources/`
Contains your views (Blade templates), raw uncompiled assets like CSS or JavaScript files (e.g., using Sass, Less, or modern JS), and language files.
*   `resources/views/`: Your application's frontend templates.
*   `resources/js/`: Your primary JavaScript files, often including `app.js` and `bootstrap.js`.
*   `resources/css/` or `resources/scss/`: Your CSS/Sass/Less files.

### `routes/`
All route definitions for your application are here. 
*   `web.php`: Routes for your web interface, which typically use sessions, CSRF protection, etc.
*   `api.php`: Stateless routes for your API, typically using token authentication.
*   `console.php`: Defines your custom Artisan commands.
*   `channels.php`: Registers your event broadcasting channels.

### `storage/`
This directory stores compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. It also commonly stores user-generated content, like avatars or uploads.

### `tests/`
Contains your automated tests. Laravel provides a good structure for both unit and feature tests using PHPUnit.

### `vendor/`
This directory contains all your Composer dependencies. You should generally not modify files in this directory.

This overview should help developers navigate the codebase more effectively.
